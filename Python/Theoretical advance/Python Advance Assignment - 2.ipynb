    "### Question Q1. \n",
    "##### What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, <b>`class`</b> is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas in Python, <b>`modules`</b> are simply files with the <b>`.py`</b> extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that we want to include in our application."

    "##### How do you make instances and classes?\n",

    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "For creating a class instance, we call a class by its name and pass the arguments which its <b>`__init__`</b> method accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example:</b> `vishwak = employee('Male',20000)` Here `vishwak` is an instance of class `employee` with attriubutes `'Male'` and `20000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas for creating a class, we use the `Class` keyword. `Class` keyword is followed by `classname` and `semicolon`.\n",

    "Instances attributes are passed to the class when an object of the class is created. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by all objects of the classs. instead each object maintains its own copy of instance attributes at object level. whereas incase of class attributes all instances of class refer to a single copy. Usually instance attributes are defined within the `__init__` method of class\n",
