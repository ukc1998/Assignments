    "What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\n",
    "\n",
    "*In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. Multiple instances of an object can be made.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. Data is safe and secure with data abstraction.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "5. Polymorphism allows the same interface for different objects, so programmers can write efficient code.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "6. Inherit feature allows programmer to inhetit the methods from existing programs.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "7. Since the class is sharable, the code can be reused."

    "The differences between a class object and an instance object are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "2. Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for a class this does not happen.\n",
    "3. A Class is created once. Many objects are created using a class.\n",
    "4. As Classes have no allocated memory, they can't be manipulated, but objects can be manipulated.\n",
    "5. class object is written as like a class name with paranthesis at right side an object at left side.and instance variable is initalized by self.instance_variable."
